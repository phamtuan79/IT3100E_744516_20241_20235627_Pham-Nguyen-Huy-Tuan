Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
- These two constructors take the same number and type of parameters, hence it will result in a error, 
because in order to differentiate between constructors, they must have different signatures.
